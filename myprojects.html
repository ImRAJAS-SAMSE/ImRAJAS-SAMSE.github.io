       <strong>Guess My Number</strong><br> In the game "Guess the Number," a player is presented with a randomly generated number
       and must guess what it is. The player is given a certain number of attempts to guess the correct number,
       and after each guess, they are told whether their guess was too high or too low. If the player guesses the correct number,
       they win the game. If they run out of attempts before guessing the correct number, they lose.<br>

       <strong>The Pig Game</strong> <br>The Pig Game is a simple dice game that can be played with two players.
       The goal of the game is to be the first player to reach a certain number of points, which is set to 100. To play the game,
        each player takes turns rolling a single die. If the player rolls a 1, they lose all their points for that turn and their turn ends.
        If they roll any other number, they can choose to either hold and add that number of points to their total score,
        or roll again and continue their turn.

    <strong>To-do List</strong> <br>A to-do list is a list of tasks that a person wants to accomplish.
